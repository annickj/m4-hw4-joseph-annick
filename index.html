            <article>
                <p>NCT, also known as Neo Culture Technology, is a South Korean boy group managed by SM Entertainment and comprises 26 members. The group is known for its unique structure, initially described as having an unlimited number of members and sub-units. However, in late 2023, it was announced that NCT Wish would be the final sub-unit and no further members would be added. Currently, the group is organized into six sub-units: NCT U, NCT 127, NCT Dream, WayV, NCT DoJaeJung, and NCT Wish. NCT U made its debut on April 9, 2016, with "The 7th Sense" and "Without You". NCT 127 debuted with "Fire Truck" and NCT Dream with "Chewing Gum". WayV made its debut in 2019, and the latest subunit, NCT Wish, debuted in 2024. Fans of NCT are officially referred to as NCTzens, as they are citizens of NCT (NCity). NCT lovingly refers to their fans as czennies, as they are as precious to them as the four seasons. NCT's official color is Neo Pearl Champagne.</p>
